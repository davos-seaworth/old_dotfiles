# dotfiles

Dotfiles and other configuration files for my current Debian install on my desktop machine. At some point I'll try and consolidate these with what's on my Arch machine (or make a repo for those).


TODO:

Create list of things needed in order to use the rc.lua as it is, because searching through the file manually and remembering everything is awful, especially on my small laptop screen.

Other things

Work on organization
